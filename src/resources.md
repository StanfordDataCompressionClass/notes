# Resources
Interested in data compression? Great! We list a few resources (apart from the lecture notes) which might be useful to take a look. 

NOTE: If you find a resource which you found useful and is not listed here, please file an github issue at https://github.com/stanfordDataCompressionClass/notes.

## 1. Software
A great way to learn about data compression is to play around with the compression algorithms themselves. 
1. [Stanford compression Library](https://github.com/kedartatwawadi/stanford_compression_library): A library of compression algorithms implemented in native python for accessibility and educational purpose. Take a look at the tutorials (in progress)  to get started! We will also be using the library as a basis for the course assignments.
2. [Audio Compression code/book](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/events/python-programs-and-book-building-audio-coder-and-deep-learning-audio) A python based implementation of audio compression, in form of tutorials. 
3. [Introduction to Digital Video compression](https://github.com/leandromoreira/digital_video_introduction): Great hands-on tutorial on digital video coding.

## 2. Video Resources
Interested in data compression? Here are some nice youtube videos to watch to get an introduction. Most of them are beginner-friendly and are useful to get a sense of the data compression. 

Here are a set of videos to watch at leisure to get an intuition for compression:
1. [Compressor Head playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb7rzMxHyOk&list=PLOU2XLYxmsIJGErt5rrCqaSGTMyyqNt2H&ab_channel=GoogleDevelopers): This is a series of short talks by a google engineer. Very good introductory videos
2. [Huffman Coding (Tom Scott)](https://youtu.be/JsTptu56GM8): I love Tom Scott and how well he explains things. Here is a nice video on Huffman coding
3. [Why Snow looks terrible on video](https://youtu.be/r6Rp-uo6HmI), [Why Night scenes look bad on video](https://youtu.be/h9j89L8eQQk): Very nice two videos by Tom Scott again which gives a brief peek into video compression algorithms
4. [PNG Image Compression](https://youtu.be/EFUYNoFRHQI): video on PNG lossless compression
5. [JPEG compression](https://youtu.be/0me3guauqOU): A bit more detailed video on JPEG compression
6. [Arithmetic coding series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE125425EC837021F): Great sequence of lectures Information theory in general and particularly on Arithmetic coding. One of the best I found on this subject.

## 3. Textbooks, research papers
Although there are no textbooks which exactly correspond to the course material, but here are few books which might be relevant. 

1. [Elements of Information Theory](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~cgong821/Wiley.Interscience.Elements.of.Information.Theory.Jul.2006.eBook-DDU.pdf): Classic textbook on Information Theory
2. [Introduction to Data Compression, Guy E. Blelloch](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~guyb/realworld/compression.pdf): Set of lecture notes/book on Data Compression by Guy E. Blelloch, CMU 2013
3. [Data Compression Explained, Matt Mahoney](http://mattmahoney.net/dc/dce.html): A nice set of lecture notes on Data Compression by Matt Mahoney.

## 4. Blogs/websites
The web is filled with great engineers and researchers writing blogs related to Data Compression. We list a few below:

1. [Christopher Olah's Blog](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-09-Visual-Information/): A fun visual introduction to Information Theory.
2. [Yann Collet's Blog](http://fastcompression.blogspot.com/): Great blog by Yann Collet on implemeting fast and efficient data compression algorithms
3. [Fabian Giesen's blog](https://fgiesen.wordpress.com/category/compression/): Blog by Fabian Giesen. (The parts related to rANS implementation are particularly great!)
4. [On understanding zlib](https://www.euccas.me/zlib/): Introduction to zlib by Euccas Chen.
5. [Modern LZ Compression](https://glinscott.github.io/lz/index.html#toc4): Walk-through of modern LZ compressors by Gary Linscott.
